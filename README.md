# Atomistic_Nodal_Approach_Conductance
Python Code for Processing LAMMPS Data generated for two data types: LAMMPS trajectory file and LAMMPS dump files. Subsequently, the code involves post-processing of the data to give interfacial heat flux, temperature discontinuity and ultimately interfacial conductance using the atomistic nodal approach.
